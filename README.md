### Render HTML with JSX

**html_of_jsx** is a JSX transformation to write HTML declaratively in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org), [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io) and [mlx](https://github.com/ocaml-mlx/mlx).

## Features

- Brings the component model to HTML
- Supports most of features from [JSX](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/jsx) (uppercase components, fragments, optional attributes, punning)
- but with a few improvements (lowercase components, no need to add annotations)
- No React idioms (no `className`, no `htmlFor`, no `onChange`, etc...)
- Integrates well with Htmx
- Type-safe, validates attributes and their types ([it can be better thought](https://github.com/davesnx/html_of_jsx/issues/2))
- Works with [OCaml](https://ocaml.org), [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io) and [mlx](https://github.com/ocaml-mlx/mlx)
- Minimal
  - `JSX.to_string` to render a JSX element to a HTML string
  - `JSX.*` to construct DOM Elements and DOM nodes (`JSX.string`, `JSX.int`, `JSX.null`, `JSX.list`)
- Created to work on the server-side, but can be used on the client-side too (with [Melange](https://melange.re))

## Installation

## Credits

This library was extracted from [server-reason-react](https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/server-reason-react) and later simplified to work only with HTML5.
