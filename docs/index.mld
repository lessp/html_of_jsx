{3 Render HTML with JSX}

{b html_of_jsx} is a JSX transformation to write HTML declaratively in {{:https://ocaml.org OCaml}, {{:https://reasonml.github.io} Reason} and {{:https://github.com/ocaml-mlx/mlx}mlx}.

This library was extracted from {{: https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/server-reason-react} server-reason-react} and later simplified to work only with HTML5.

{1 API}

{!Jsx} module that exposes some helpers to construct elements and {!Html_of_jsx} to render them, the rest are functions with labelled arguments.

{1 Overview}

- Brings the component model to HTML
- Supports most of the JSX features (uppercase components, fragments, optional attributes, punning, childrens, etc...)
- but with a few improvements (lowercase components, no need to add annotations)
- Integrates well with Htmx (see the {!page-"htmx"} page)
- No React idioms (no [className], no [htmlFor], no [onChange], etc...), just plain HTML5
- Type-safe, validates attributes and their types
- Works with {{:https://ocaml.org OCaml}, {{:https://reasonml.github.io} Reason} and {{:https://github.com/ocaml-mlx/mlx}mlx}
- Created to work on the server-side, but can be used on the client-side too (with {{:https://melange.re} Melange})
